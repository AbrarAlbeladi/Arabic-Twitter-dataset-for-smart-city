Arabic Twitter dataset for smart city

The dataset was constructed by leveraging Twitter's search Application Programming Interface (API) using Python  programming. It is evident that Python and its associated libraries are emerged and widely-used as they are flexible for conducting data analytics, particularly in the domain of machine learning. To ensure the relevance of the dataset to the intended application, hashtags associated with the three largest smart cities in Saudi Arabia, namely Riyadh, Jeddah, and NEOM, were used as search terms. Consequently, the most relevant hashtags including "\#smart\_cities", "\#NEOM",  \<   مدن مستدامة  >, \<   مدن ذكية  >, \<  مدينة ذكية  >, and
\<  مدينة مستدامة >, were extracted using inbuilt Python function. 

The initial seed terms were carefully chosen to reflect the scope of the study and to ensure the suitability of the extracted data for subsequent analysis.

In this study, the tweepy library was used to extract  Arabic tweets from the Twitter platform. Moreover, the official Twitter accounts of the target smart cities were included as search keywords to enhance the data collection process. Given that the objective of this study was to conduct a longitudinal and continuous analysis of customer sentiments, data was collected over a period spanning from January 2000 to 2023. This time period was deemed appropriate as it encompasses the reactions of people to the introduction of the Saudi smart cities’ new index. Despite the seemingly short duration, this time frame resulted in the acquisition of the largest Arabic Twitter dataset. It was recognized that the dataset would subsequently decrease in size due to the elimination of spam and retweets. The initial dataset comprised of 12000  tweets, which were later filtered and cleaned based on location, time-zone, and stratified random sampling. As a result, the dataset was reduced to 10,500 Saudi tweets, which formed the comprehensive dataset.

Given the targeted cities in this study are situated in Saudi Arabia, an additional filtering process was conducted to identify tweets that originated from Saudi users based on their location and time zone information. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ranks seventh globally in terms of the number of personal social media accounts. However, it was observed that several tweets lacked location information in the user profiles. To overcome this limitation, a comprehensive list of Saudi Arabian city names, landmarks, and nicknames were utilized as supplementary labels for tweet user locations. Furthermore, a list obtained from the GeoNames website, a geographical database that encompasses 8 million place names for each country, including 25,253 place names for Saudi Arabia, was also employed following the approach of Mubarak and Darwish.
